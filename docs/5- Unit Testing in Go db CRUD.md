- Unit tests in Go are locatedÂ **in the same package (that is, the same folder) as the tested function
- <https://github.com/lib/pq>
- when we import the lib/pq pkg we need to add underscore _ so that the compiler won't delete it after saving the file.
- <https://github.com/stretchr/testify>
- Unit Tests must be independent
